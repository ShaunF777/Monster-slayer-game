# 🐉 Dragon Repeller - RPG Mini Game

Welcome to **Dragon Repeller**, a fun, browser-based role-playing game (RPG) built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you're a brave hero trying to save your town from an evil dragon. Venture through different locations, fight monsters, earn gold, upgrade weapons, and uncover secret paths.

## 🎮 Game Objective

Your goal is to defeat the **dragon** who is preventing townsfolk from leaving the village. Along the way, you’ll explore:

- The **town square** (your starting point)
- A **store** (where you can buy health or weapons)
- A **cave** (home to monsters like slimes and fanged beasts)
- A **secret easter egg path** (for curious adventurers)

You gain experience points (XP), collect gold, and manage your health as you progress through battles.

## 🚀 How to Play

3. **Fight monsters** in the cave to gain XP and gold.
4. **Defeat the dragon** to win the game.
5. **Be careful!** If your health drops to 0, the game ends.

## 🖼️ Optional Features

You can add **background images** that change based on the game events (e.g. sword when you max out weapons, hidden door in the easter egg room). These can be handled by updating a background image dynamically via JavaScript.

Example snippet:
```js
document.body.style.backgroundImage = "url('./assets/sword.jpg')";
```

✅ Future Ideas

    Add sound effects and background music

    Save/load player progress

    Add new weapons or attacks

    Add more locations (dungeons, forests, etc.)
